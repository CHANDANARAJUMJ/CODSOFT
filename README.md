# CodSoft Internship - C++ Programming

## Overview

This repository contains the work I completed during my internship at CodSoft, focusing on C++ programming. The objective of this internship was to enhance my understanding of C++ and to develop practical skills through hands-on projects.

## Learning Objectives

- Deepen knowledge of C++ syntax and semantics.
- Understand object-oriented programming (OOP) concepts in C++.
- Gain experience with C++ Standard Library and algorithms.
- Develop problem-solving skills using C++.
- Apply C++ in real-world scenarios.

## Project Details

- *Project Name*: Tic-Tac-Toe Game, To-Do List, Library Management System
- *Description*:
   - *Tic-Tac-Toe Game*:
      - User-friendly interface for input.
      - Game logic to check for win/draw conditions.
      - Reset functionality to start a new game after completion.
  
  - *To-Do List*:
    - Add tasks with descriptions.
    - View all tasks in a neatly formatted list.
    - Delete tasks upon completion.
  
  - *Library Management System*: A console-based application that enables users to manage and organize a library's collection of books. The system allows users to add new books, search 
     for existing books, update book details, and remove books from the collection. It also provides functionalities for tracking borrowed books and returning them.
    - *Key Features*:
      -Book Database: Books are stored in a vector, with each book having attributes like title, author, ISBN, and availability status.
      -Book Search: The search function allows users to find books by title, author, or ISBN.
      -Book Checkout: The system checks if the book is available and assigns it to a borrower.
      -Book Return: It updates the availability status and calculates fines for overdue books.
      -Fine Calculation: A simple calculation based on the number of days the book is overdue.
      -User Interface: A basic console-based interface for interaction.

## Tools and Technologies

- *Programming Language*: C++
- *IDE*: Online C++ Compiler (e.g., Replit, OnlineGDB, etc.)
- *Libraries/Frameworks*: Standard C++ Libraries (no external libraries were used)

## Challenges and Learning Outcomes

- *Challenges Faced*:
  - Handling real-time input/output operations in an online environment.
  - Ensuring compatibility and smooth execution across different online compilers.
  - Debugging without traditional IDE tools and features.

- *What I Learned*:
  - Adaptability to different development environments, including online platforms.
  - Enhanced skills in writing portable and reliable C++ code.
  - Experience in managing projects without dependency on specific tools or IDEs.

## Future Improvements

- *To-Do List*: Explore online storage solutions to save tasks across sessions.
- *Tic-Tac-Toe Game*: Implement multiplayer functionality with remote players using online platforms.
- *Library Management System*: Future enhancements could include implementing a graphical user interface (GUI), integrating a database for persistent storage, and adding user authentication and detailed reporting features.
